This project consists of an offline hacking & reconnaissance tool enhanced by AI, as well as having Bluetooth connection capabilities, which we call Wyrm. The tool is run off of a Raspberry Pi 5â€™s, which is used not only as a mobile device, but also its capability of running multiple operating systems. Reconnaissance, weaponization, and delivery were the main criteria for the tools installed onto the device. Additionally, a local Ollama LLM was chosen to enhance the use of the tools by providing guidance on flags and commands. All code is packaged within a GitHub repository found here. The significance of this project is to determine whether a comprehensive mobile red team device can provide red team operators ease of use, persistence, and efficiency while simulating an attack.

This was an academic project and created for educational and research purposes only.
